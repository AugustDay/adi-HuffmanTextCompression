# adi-HuffmanTextCompression
Custom implementation of Huffman Encoding Tree to compress a text file.

Main opens and reads the given text files, CodingTree takes a string as an argument (the full text to be encoded) and performs the compression algorithm. Main then takes the finished, compressed string and writes it to an output file as desired.
